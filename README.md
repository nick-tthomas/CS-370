I was working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, I have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agentâ€™s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal.

I have been provided with some starter code and a sample environment where your pirate agent will be placed. I was needed to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train your pirate agent. Finally, I was also been asked to write a design defense that demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental AI concepts involved in creating and training your intelligent agent.
Computer scientists engage in a diverse array of activities that revolve around problem solving and innovation. They design algorithms, develop software and applications, analyze data, create intelligent systems like AI agents, and much more. The field's significance lies in its ability to address complex challenges, enhance efficiency, and drive technological progress across various industries.

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves breaking it down into manageable components. This entails understanding the problem's context, identifying relevant data and algorithms, and formulating a step-by-step plan to reach a solution. Iteration, experimentation, and collaboration are integral components of problem solving in computer science.

Computer scientists have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. When designing solutions, they must prioritize user safety, privacy, and well-being. Ensuring the security of data and systems, mitigating biases in AI algorithms, and providing transparent user interfaces are all part of this responsibility. Additionally, computer scientists need to uphold professional integrity, adhere to established standards, and consider the broader societal impacts of their work. Balancing innovation with ethical considerations is crucial for building trust and ensuring the positive impact of technological advancements.
